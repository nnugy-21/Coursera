## About this Module
The other popular mobile operating system is, of course, iOS. So this week you'll do very similar tasks to last week -- learning how to take models and run them on iOS. You'll need some programming background with Swift for iOS to fully understand everything we go through, but even if you don't have this expertise, I think this weeks content is something you'll find fun to explore -- and you'll learn how to build a variety of ML applications that run on this important operating system!

## Learning Objectives
* Understand how incorporate a TF Lite model into iOS apps
* Create an iOS app that performs image classification
* Create an iOS app that performs object detection
