## About this Module
Now that you've looked at TensorFlow Lite and explored building apps on Android and iOS that use it, the next and final step is to explore embedded systems like Raspberry Pi, and learn how to get your models running on that. The nice thing is that the Pi is a full Linux system, so it can run Python, allowing you to either use the full TensorFlow for Training and Inference, or just the Interpreter for Inference. I'd recommend the latter, as training on a Pi can be slow!

## Learning Objectives
* Understand how incorporate a TF Lite model into the Raspberry Pi

## Installing TensorFlow on RaspberryPI
* Option1: [Source for the RPI](https://github.com/tensorflow/build/tree/master/raspberry_pi_builds)
* Option2: [Working on a virtual environment](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
* Option3: [TF interpreter](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python)
