## About this Module
This week we'll look at Computer Vision problems, including some of the unique considerations when using JavaScript, such as handling thousands of images for training. By the end of this module you will know how to build a site that lets you draw in the browser and recognizes your handwritten digits!

## Learning Objectives
* Use tf-vis to visulize the output of callbacks
* Use a convolutional neural network to build a handwriting classifier
* Use a sprite sheet to train a classifier
