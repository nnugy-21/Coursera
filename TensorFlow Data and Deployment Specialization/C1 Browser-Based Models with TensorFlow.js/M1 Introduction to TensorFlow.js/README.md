## About this Course
Welcome to Browser-based Models with TensorFlow.js, the first course of the TensorFlow for Data and Deployment Specialization. In this first course, weâ€™re going to look at how to train machine learning models in the browser and how to use them to perform inference using JavaScript. This will allow you to use machine learning directly in the browser as well as on backend servers like Node.js. In the first week of the course, we are going to build some basic models using JavaScript and we'll execute them in simple web pages.

## Learning Specialization
* Use TensorFlow.js to build and train simple machine learning models in JavaScript
* Describe the key characteristics of one-hot encoding
* Use TensorFlow.js to load data from a CSV file
* Use Web Server for Chrome to serve web pages from a local folder over the network using HTTP.
