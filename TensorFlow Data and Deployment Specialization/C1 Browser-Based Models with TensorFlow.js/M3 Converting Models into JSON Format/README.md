## About this Module
This week we'll see how to take models that have been created with TensorFlow in Python and convert them to JSON format so that they can run in the browser using Javascript. We will start by looking at two models that have already been pre-converted. One of them is going to be a toxicity classifier, which uses NLP to determine if a phrase is toxic in a number of categories; the other one is Mobilenet which can be used to detect content in images. By the end of this module, you will train a model in Python yourself and convert it to JSON format using the tensorflow.js converter.

## Learning Objectives
* Use the tensorflow.js converter to convert a Keras model to JSON format
* Use a toxicity model to determine if a phrase is toxic in a number of categories
* Use Mobilenet to detect objects in images
