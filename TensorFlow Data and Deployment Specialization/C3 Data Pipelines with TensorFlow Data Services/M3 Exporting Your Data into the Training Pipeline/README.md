## About this Module
This week you will extend your knowledge of data pipelines

## Learning Objectives
* Use different libraries and techniques to export your data into new training pipelines
* Practice with pre-built pipelines that reduce your development time significantly
* Create different feature columns using functions like bucketing, hashing and tokenizing
* Compare and contrast different data types present in TensorFlow Data class with the practice quiz while elaborating more on data operations like one-hot encoding, bucketing and tokenizing
* Apply various data operations in the assignment to create different types of feature columns which you see frequently in different ML problem statements, compile and train them on a custom csv dataset that is loaded using tf.Data API
