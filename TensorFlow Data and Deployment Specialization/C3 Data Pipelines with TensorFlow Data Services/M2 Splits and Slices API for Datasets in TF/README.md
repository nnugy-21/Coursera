## About this Module
In this week, you will construct train/validation/test splits of any dataset - either custom or present in TensorFlow hub dataset library - using Splits API

## Learning Obejctives
* Compare Python slicing operation with Splits API
* Explore TFRecords and individual samples in a dataset
* Investigate feature descriptors
* Identify applications of the Splits API to create custom dataset splits and examine TFRecords and Feature descriptors which help you gain more information about your dataset
* Load a pre-trained feature vector and create custom train/test/validation set splits using Splits API which makes it easier to load data for training and evaluation in your ML pipeline
