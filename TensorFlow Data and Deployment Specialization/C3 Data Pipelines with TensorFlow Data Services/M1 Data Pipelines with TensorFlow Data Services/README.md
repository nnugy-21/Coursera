## About this Module
This week, you will be able to perform efficient ETL tasks using Tensorflow Data Services APIs

## Learning Objectives
* Work with familiar datasets like MNIST, Horses or Humans and Rock, Paper and Scissors, and execute extract and transform tasks by loading and batching these built-in TensorFlow Datasets
* Analyze the metadata and information of each dataset
* Create a streamlined pipeline for model training
* Reinforce your knowledge of TensorFlow Data Services API with the practice quiz
* Apply your data pipeline building skills in the assignment by creating a complete ETL pipeline using the TFDS API, and defining a simple CNN model which can be trained later on
