## Train Dev and Test Distribution

If we want to work efficiently, we need to make sure that our training and dev set come from the same distribution as our expected test set. <br>
I.E. if we want to test face recognition in Indonesia, we need to make sure that our training and dev set also come from Indonesia, not from China or USA
