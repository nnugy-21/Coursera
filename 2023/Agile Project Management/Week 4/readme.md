# Case study: Forming a value-driven task force
In the previous video, you learned that value-driven delivery is critical to Agile and Scrum project management. In this reading, you will read a case study and analyze how Agile brought value to the organization. 

## Learning from case studies
As you pursue your career in project management, you will come across many resources for learning about other companies and their journeys to becoming Agile. 

Case studies—in-depth, data-driven analyses of a business, community, or organization—are valuable tools for gaining key industry insights and learning from the successes and failures of your competitors. 

When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.

As you read, ask yourself: 

* What is the issue?
* What is the goal of the analysis?
* What is the context of the problem?
* What key facts should be considered?
* What alternatives are available to the decision-maker?
* What would you recommend, and why?

## Value-driven delivery at Sephora
The case study linked below is about how the teams at Sephora, the multinational retailer of personal care and beauty products, created value-driven delivery by forming an Agile task force. 

As the case study details, Sephora’s goal was to develop an organized and efficient process for rolling out customer-centered initiatives. The beauty retailer wanted to maximize their paid media and create custom messaging that was personalized to meet their customers’ needs.

Keep the questions above in mind as you read through the case study. Notice how the various roles and responsibilities were essential to the process and how the company brought people from across the organization together to ideate, test, and analyze. 

When you are finished, think about how Scrum benefitted Sephora and how it improved their overall business model.

# Product roadmaps: Benefits, pitfalls, and best practices
As you learned in the previous video, roadmaps are an important part of any long-running project. In this reading, we will summarize the benefits of and best practices for developing a product roadmap, as well as highlight some of the pitfalls you might encounter. 

You may see different types of roadmaps as you continue your project management career. Each team or company may interpret the roadmap slightly differently. Here are some of the various types:

* Project roadmap
* Product roadmap
* Value roadmap
* Lean roadmap
* Agile roadmap

Roadmaps are often represented visually and many try to fit the roadmap on one page so that reviewers can notice the big picture of the product timeline.

The benefits of developing and maintaining a product roadmap are numerous:

* Clarifying the sequence of deliverables 
* Showing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. In other words, their ultimate goal. 
* Showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one big delivery at the end)
* Helping stakeholders roughly understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

There are also some pitfalls around roadmaps to avoid:
* Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangeable. This may cause stakeholders to impede teams’ ability to adapt in response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes.
* Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough and improving specificity as the dates get closer
* Putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producing the deliverables 

Here are some best practices to help you get the most from your roadmaps:
* Make it highly noticeable to the team and refer to it frequently.
* Clearly indicate the highest priority items.
* If possible, clearly indicate the highest value items.
* Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning. 
* Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the blueprint for the project.

## Key takeaway
Roadmaps are important for any well-managed project, but they are especially useful to Agile teams. Having a shared roadmap about what the team is delivering over a longer time period is an important way to connect the work that the team does on the sprints with the broader vision for the project. This helps the team stay motivated through the rough patches and leads to a great sense of accomplishment as roadmap deliverables are achieved. 

# Responding to change over following a plan
As we learned in the beginning of this course, Agile dedicates one of its four values to “Responding to change over following a plan.” This reading aims to clarify some important considerations when implementing a change to the release plan.

The best way to think about changing your plan is to break it down into three stages:

* Identifying a needed change 
* Deciding to make the change
* Implementing the change

## Step 1: Identifying a needed change 
First, how do you know if your plan needs to be changed? Here are some aspects of your project that may be candidates for change: scope, time, and costs (or resources). As we previously learned, these are called the “triple constraint,” and they provide a great framework for evaluating change in Agile and traditional projects.

* In Agile, scope refers to the contents of the product roadmap, the items in the Product Backlog, the intended deliverables of the project, and the intended users or customers. This is the “what” of the project.
* Time refers to the elements of time or layout of the deliverables over a period of time. This could include the product roadmap timeline, release schedule, or even the Sprint duration. This is the “when” of the project.
* Costs or resources refer to the makeup of the Development Team, project managers, and product owners, and other “business people” as well as the equipment available to create the deliverable. This is the “how” of the project.

Agile projects are open to change in any of these three areas, and a needed change could be identified by any project stakeholders, including the Product Owner, Project Manager, Scrum Master, or the Development Team themselves. Sources of identified changes could include:

* Customer feedback on early prototypes results in new features and some deleted features (scope change)
* Sprint Retrospective identifies an area of understaffing (cost or resource change)
* Critical project dependencies or deliverable dates have shifted, resulting in a change to the project roadmap (schedule or time change)

## Step 2: Deciding to make the change
Next, how do you decide to actually make the change? There are many decision-making models available to reference. Here are the basic steps involved in most of these models:

* Identify the “decider.” It is best to have a single person—generally the Product Owner or a senior stakeholder—in the role of decider to ensure consistency and accountability. 
* Develop and share what factors are important to the decision, and gather supporting data that will help the decider make the decision.
* Openly discuss the benefits and costs of the decision. Identify areas of uncertainty and capture assumptions.
* Document the decision.

## Step 3: Implementing the change
Once changes are approved, it is important to do several things:

* Document the change and decision-making process. 
<br>Include meeting notes, pros/cons lists, assumptions, and data that went into making the decision to change the project.
* Capture the change in any affected artifacts. 
<br>Update any roadmaps, Product Backlogs, staffing plans, and integration dates, and include a reference to the source of the change so that stakeholders can refer back to it. Consider using revision labels or dates on affected documents like “version 1.2” or “updated on December 20th” so that the team can clearly recognize that the document has changed.
* Share the change with all affected stakeholders. 
<br>You can do this through many types of forums: in person at meetings, in documentation and meeting notes, and through email announcements. 
* Monitor the change for a certain amount of time. 
<br>This ensures that the team is supportive and aware of the change.

If the change was not approved during the decision stage, you should still document the information and logic used to make the decision. You may even consider putting a change on hold while you wait for more information to make the decision with higher confidence.

# The influencer change framework
In the previous video, we learned how to apply organizational change management techniques to your team in Agile or Scrum. In this reading, we will learn about the influencer change framework developed by Joseph Grenny, Kerry Patterson, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler in the book INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change, which explores the power of influence in facilitating organizational change. 

## What does it mean to be an influencer? 

These days, when we hear the word influencer, some might think of social media stardom. But being an influencer is bigger than getting “likes”—it is about someone’s ability to lead and influence others to change their behaviors, hearts, and minds to produce meaningful, sustainable results. As a project manager, you will be asked to lead efforts that require this level of change, and applying this model can lead to a big impact.

To influence is different than to persuade. Persuasion is short-term, while influence is lasting. In order to have real influence, you need others to trust you, consider you an authority, and have confidence in your decisions. As a project manager in Agile projects, you may use influence to facilitate organizational change or to get a team to try a new tool, process, or technology. When facilitating organizational change, influence is the difference between temporary changes in behavior and deep change in culture and values.

## Three keys to influence 
The three keys to influence, as researched by the authors of this model, are to clarify measurable results, find vital behaviors, and use the six sources of influence. Let’s break each of these down.

## Clarify measurable results
You can’t influence others to change until you know what you want, why you want it, and when you want it. You may recall that effective results are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T). When setting goals for a project, remember to ask yourself what the “why” entails. Are the results specific and measurable? Is it what you intended? Is it time-bound? Also, make sure the measures are visible and transparent to the entire team throughout the change.

## Find vital behaviors 
A vital behavior is the action an individual takes at a pivotal moment in the context of the change they are seeking. For example, if a member of the Development Team is seeking to increase involvement of the Product Owner throughout the development process, they might exhibit a vital behavior when they have just finished mocking up a new feature. Instead of just continuing on to the next item on their to-do list, they might send an email to the Product Owner to review their work and provide feedback. By choosing to include or exclude their Product Owner at a pivotal moment, the developer is taking a small action to enact the change they want to create.

As we have discussed, real change happens when you can change the behaviors of others. Whether you are changing the minds of your team, stakeholders, or customers, it is important to track their current behavior patterns and understand the behaviors you need them to adopt in order to make the change you are seeking. 

To determine vital behaviors, you might consult experts, scan the best and most-cited articles and research, or perform a culture assessment by identifying norms and customs within the team. When identifying the behaviors, evaluate which behaviors are constructive to the change you wish to promote and notice examples of those who succeed where most others fail.

## Use the six sources of influence
The authors of INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change studied companies and individuals who were successful or unsuccessful with implementing change, and they identified six sources or factors that were correlated with successful change. When determining how to influence your target audience to create change, you should consider using all of these sources to increase your chances of success. You may even consider prioritizing these based on your knowledge of your audience. For example, some target audiences may be most swayed by financial incentives, while others may be more incentivized by social justice impacts.  

Here are the six sources uncovered by the authors in their research, including a sample idea of how you can use these examples in your work in tandem with our Product Owner involvement scenario (described earlier):  

* Personal motivation: Are the individuals motivated internally to engage in the new behavior? Can you help them “love what they hate”? 
<br>Example: Ensure the Product Owner is timely, appreciative, and effective while giving their feedback. 
* Personal ability: Are the individuals capable of performing the behavior? Do they have the ability, knowledge, and skills to “do what they can't”?
<br>Example: Ensure that the developer knows how to use the available demo tools and can easily send a quick video of the new feature in their email to the Product Owner. 
* Social motivation: Are there social contacts or networks encouraging or discouraging this new behavior? 
<br>Example: Have the Development Team members remind each other in the Daily Scrum to email the Product Owner before they finalize the work.
* Social ability: Does the team have resources within their social network to help them carry out the new behaviors?
<br>Example: Give the Development Team a tool to track all of their demos to the Product Owner during the Sprint. 
* Structural motivation: Are there rewards or incentives that they will receive if they perform the new behaviors? 
<br>Example: Provide a coffee gift card Sprint award that the Product Owner gets to award after each Sprint.
* Structural ability: Are there environmental factors at play that either deter or support the new behavior? Can you make the incorrect behavior harder to do than the correct behavior?
<br>Example: Add a rule to the content management system that pre-populates the name of the Product Owner in the reviewer list. 

## Key takeaway
These three keys to influence make up the influencer change framework and will improve your chances of success with a change. Clarify measurable results, find vital behaviors, and leverage six sources of influence in tandem to lead an organization, team, or an individual to experience positive change.
