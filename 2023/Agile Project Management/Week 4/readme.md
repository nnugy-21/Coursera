# Case study: Forming a value-driven task force
In the previous video, you learned that value-driven delivery is critical to Agile and Scrum project management. In this reading, you will read a case study and analyze how Agile brought value to the organization. 

## Learning from case studies
As you pursue your career in project management, you will come across many resources for learning about other companies and their journeys to becoming Agile. 

Case studies—in-depth, data-driven analyses of a business, community, or organization—are valuable tools for gaining key industry insights and learning from the successes and failures of your competitors. 

When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.

As you read, ask yourself: 

* What is the issue?
* What is the goal of the analysis?
* What is the context of the problem?
* What key facts should be considered?
* What alternatives are available to the decision-maker?
* What would you recommend, and why?

## Value-driven delivery at Sephora
The case study linked below is about how the teams at Sephora, the multinational retailer of personal care and beauty products, created value-driven delivery by forming an Agile task force. 

As the case study details, Sephora’s goal was to develop an organized and efficient process for rolling out customer-centered initiatives. The beauty retailer wanted to maximize their paid media and create custom messaging that was personalized to meet their customers’ needs.

Keep the questions above in mind as you read through the case study. Notice how the various roles and responsibilities were essential to the process and how the company brought people from across the organization together to ideate, test, and analyze. 

When you are finished, think about how Scrum benefitted Sephora and how it improved their overall business model.

# Product roadmaps: Benefits, pitfalls, and best practices
As you learned in the previous video, roadmaps are an important part of any long-running project. In this reading, we will summarize the benefits of and best practices for developing a product roadmap, as well as highlight some of the pitfalls you might encounter. 

You may see different types of roadmaps as you continue your project management career. Each team or company may interpret the roadmap slightly differently. Here are some of the various types:

* Project roadmap
* Product roadmap
* Value roadmap
* Lean roadmap
* Agile roadmap

Roadmaps are often represented visually and many try to fit the roadmap on one page so that reviewers can notice the big picture of the product timeline.

The benefits of developing and maintaining a product roadmap are numerous:

* Clarifying the sequence of deliverables 
* Showing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. In other words, their ultimate goal. 
* Showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one big delivery at the end)
* Helping stakeholders roughly understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

There are also some pitfalls around roadmaps to avoid:
* Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangeable. This may cause stakeholders to impede teams’ ability to adapt in response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes.
* Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough and improving specificity as the dates get closer
* Putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producing the deliverables 

Here are some best practices to help you get the most from your roadmaps:
* Make it highly noticeable to the team and refer to it frequently.
* Clearly indicate the highest priority items.
* If possible, clearly indicate the highest value items.
* Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning. 
* Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the blueprint for the project.

## Key takeaway
Roadmaps are important for any well-managed project, but they are especially useful to Agile teams. Having a shared roadmap about what the team is delivering over a longer time period is an important way to connect the work that the team does on the sprints with the broader vision for the project. This helps the team stay motivated through the rough patches and leads to a great sense of accomplishment as roadmap deliverables are achieved. 

# Responding to change over following a plan
As we learned in the beginning of this course, Agile dedicates one of its four values to “Responding to change over following a plan.” This reading aims to clarify some important considerations when implementing a change to the release plan.

The best way to think about changing your plan is to break it down into three stages:

* Identifying a needed change 
* Deciding to make the change
* Implementing the change

## Step 1: Identifying a needed change 
First, how do you know if your plan needs to be changed? Here are some aspects of your project that may be candidates for change: scope, time, and costs (or resources). As we previously learned, these are called the “triple constraint,” and they provide a great framework for evaluating change in Agile and traditional projects.

* In Agile, scope refers to the contents of the product roadmap, the items in the Product Backlog, the intended deliverables of the project, and the intended users or customers. This is the “what” of the project.
* Time refers to the elements of time or layout of the deliverables over a period of time. This could include the product roadmap timeline, release schedule, or even the Sprint duration. This is the “when” of the project.
* Costs or resources refer to the makeup of the Development Team, project managers, and product owners, and other “business people” as well as the equipment available to create the deliverable. This is the “how” of the project.

Agile projects are open to change in any of these three areas, and a needed change could be identified by any project stakeholders, including the Product Owner, Project Manager, Scrum Master, or the Development Team themselves. Sources of identified changes could include:

* Customer feedback on early prototypes results in new features and some deleted features (scope change)
* Sprint Retrospective identifies an area of understaffing (cost or resource change)
* Critical project dependencies or deliverable dates have shifted, resulting in a change to the project roadmap (schedule or time change)

## Step 2: Deciding to make the change
Next, how do you decide to actually make the change? There are many decision-making models available to reference. Here are the basic steps involved in most of these models:

* Identify the “decider.” It is best to have a single person—generally the Product Owner or a senior stakeholder—in the role of decider to ensure consistency and accountability. 
* Develop and share what factors are important to the decision, and gather supporting data that will help the decider make the decision.
* Openly discuss the benefits and costs of the decision. Identify areas of uncertainty and capture assumptions.
* Document the decision.

## Step 3: Implementing the change
Once changes are approved, it is important to do several things:

* Document the change and decision-making process. 
<br>Include meeting notes, pros/cons lists, assumptions, and data that went into making the decision to change the project.
* Capture the change in any affected artifacts. 
<br>Update any roadmaps, Product Backlogs, staffing plans, and integration dates, and include a reference to the source of the change so that stakeholders can refer back to it. Consider using revision labels or dates on affected documents like “version 1.2” or “updated on December 20th” so that the team can clearly recognize that the document has changed.
* Share the change with all affected stakeholders. 
<br>You can do this through many types of forums: in person at meetings, in documentation and meeting notes, and through email announcements. 
* Monitor the change for a certain amount of time. 
<br>This ensures that the team is supportive and aware of the change.

If the change was not approved during the decision stage, you should still document the information and logic used to make the decision. You may even consider putting a change on hold while you wait for more information to make the decision with higher confidence.
