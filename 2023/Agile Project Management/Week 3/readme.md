# Product Backlog: The Scrum Guide overview

## Product Backlog and Product Goal

In this lesson, you are learning about an important Scrum artifact: the Product Backlog. To recap, the Product Backlog is an ordered list of what needs to be done to improve a product. It is the single authoritative source for items the Scrum Team works on. During Product Backlog refinement, items are broken down and further defined by adding details. These details can vary, but often include such attributes as description, value, order, estimate, and size. 

The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team, and it is included in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog defines what tasks will fulfill the Product Goal.

To learn more about the Product Backlog and Product Goal, please read this overview from the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-backlog).

# The components of user stories and epics

In the previous video, we introduced user stories and epics. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a deliverable told from the perspective of the user. Creating user stories helps the team develop a solution that is always centered around the user’s needs and overall experience. 

You also learned that epics are a collection of user stories. Think of the concept of user stories in terms of books or films. A story is one single narrative, while an epic is a set of several related, independent stories. Each story tells a specific chronicle, while an epic gives a high-level view of the overall arc. 

## User stories

The driving factor behind every Scrum project is putting the customer first. User stories are a key component of ensuring that customers are satisfied with the product. A team writes a user story from the perspective of the user. Not only do user stories provide insight into what goals the user wants to achieve, but they enable collaboration, inspire creative solutions, and create momentum by giving the team a small win when the stories are developed. 

When writing user stories, you will need to include the following components: 

User persona. What is your user like? What is their relation to the project? What goals do they have? 

Definition of Done. This refers to an agreed upon set of items that must be completed before a user story can be considered complete. 

Tasks. What are the key activities needed to complete the user story?

Any feedback already provided. If you are adding features to an existing product and you have already received feedback from customers on a past iteration, make sure to consider this feedback.  

## I.N.V.E.S.T.

Recall from the video that your user stories should meet the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria: 

Independent: The story’s completion is not dependent on another story.

Negotiable: There is room for discussion about this item.

Valuable: Completing the user story has to deliver value. 

Estimable: The Definition of Done must be clear so that the team can give each user story an estimate. 

Small: Each user story needs to be able to fit within a planned Sprint.

Testable: A test can be conducted to check that it meets the criteria.

Let’s imagine you are working on a project for a local library. The library hopes to launch a website so that customers can read reviews before they check out books from the branch. The typical template for a user story looks like this: As a "user role", I want this "action" so that I can get this "value". Therefore, an example user story for this situation might read: As an avid reader, I want to be able to read reviews before I check out a book from my local branch so that I know I am getting a book I am interested in.

## Epics

An epic’s purpose is to help manage related user stories. In this post, Mike Cohn, the inventor of the term “epic” as it relates to Scrum, describes epic as a “very large user story”—one that could not be delivered within a single iteration and may need to be split into smaller stories. The team should discuss together and reach a shared view of how to write and capture their user stories and epics. Keep in mind, epics are just larger user stories that are there to help organize the project. 

Let’s imagine you are creating user stories and epics based on the previous example. User stories may include customers wanting to read reviews of books on the website or wanting to add books to their cart. These user stories could fall into the “website creation” epic. 

Another user story could be that customers want to walk into the library and easily find the non-fiction section. This would fall under the “organization of the physical space” epic.

So rather than those various user stories appearing in a list together, they are organized into sections, or epics.

It’s important to note that while the Product Owner can write user stories and epics, a Developer can also write them as long as the Product Owner remains accountable for the Product Backlog item.

## Key takeaway
  
Epics allow you to keep track of large, loosely-defined ideas, while user stories are a much smaller unit of work, inspired directly from the end user or customer. Both user stories and epics help teams ensure they are delivering value to the customer.


# Agile effort estimation techniques
There are all kinds of techniques to use when estimating effort in an Agile way. Effective relative effort estimation leads to successful and predictable sprint outcomes, which leads to a successful project overall. Generally speaking, the main steps to Agile estimation are the same, even if the specific approach varies. Some examples of Agile estimation techniques are: 

* Planning Poker™
* Dot Voting
* The Bucket System
* Large/Uncertain/Small
* Ordering Method
* Affinity Mapping

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79896959/227766320-782dc15f-634a-47d2-8863-e05d4678e1c0.png)

## Planning Poker™
This particular method is well-known and commonly used when Scrum teams have to make effort estimates for a small number of items (under 10). Planning Poker is consensus-based, meaning that everyone has to agree on the number chosen. In this technique, each individual has a deck of cards with numbers from the Fibonacci sequence on them. The Fibonacci sequence is where a number is the sum of the last two numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). 

Sometimes, Planning Poker decks also include cards with coffee cups and question marks on them. The question mark card means that the person doesn’t understand what is being discussed or doesn’t have enough information to draw a conclusion. The coffee cup card means that the person needs a break.

The Planning Poker strategy is used in Sprint Planning meetings. As each Product Backlog item/user story is discussed, each team member lays a card face down on the table. Then, everyone turns their card over at the same time and the team discusses the estimates, particularly when they are far apart from one another. By first hiding the estimates, the group avoids any bias that is presented when numbers are said aloud. Sometimes, when hearing numbers aloud, people react to that estimate or the estimator themselves, and it changes what their initial thought may have been. In Planning Poker, teams can easily avoid that bias.

## Dot Voting 
Dot Voting, like Planning Poker, is also good for sprints with a low number of Sprint Backlog items. In Dot Voting, each team member starts with small dot stickers, color-coded by the estimated effort required (e.g., S=green, M=blue, L=orange, XL=red). The items or user stories are written out on pieces of paper placed around a table or put up on the wall. Then, team members walk around the table and add their colored stickers to the items. 

## The Bucket System
The Bucket System is helpful for backlogs with many items since it can be done very quickly. In fact, a couple hundred items can be estimated in just one hour with the Bucket System. The Bucket System is an effective strategy for sizing items because it explores each item in terms of pre-determined "buckets" of complexity. Keep in mind that these buckets are metaphorical; this strategy doesn't require the use of actual buckets, and instead uses sticky notes or note cards as buckets.

In this technique, the team starts by setting up a line of note cards down the center of the table, each marked with a number representing a level of effort. Then, the team writes each item or user story on a card. Each person draws and reads a random item,  then places it somewhere along the line of numbered note cards. There is no need to discuss further with the team. If a person draws an item that they do not understand, then they can offer it to someone else to place. Additionally, if a person finds an item that they think does not fit where it was placed, they can discuss it with the team until a consensus about a more accurate placement is reached. Team members should spend no more than 120 seconds on each item.  

## Large/Uncertain/Small 
Large/Uncertain/Small is another quick method of rough estimation. It is great for product backlogs that have several similar or comparable items. 

This is the same general idea as the Bucket System, but instead of several buckets, you only use three categories: large, uncertain, and small. Starting with the simpler, more obvious user stories, the team places the items in one of the categories. Then, the team discusses and places more complex items until each is assigned to a category.

## Ordering Method
The Ordering Method is ideal for projects with a smaller team and a large number of Product Backlog items. First, a scale is prepared and items are randomly placed ranging from low to high. Then, one at a time, each team member either moves any item one spot lower or higher on the scale or passes their turn. This continues until team members no longer want to move any items. 

## Affinity Mapping
Affinity Mapping is useful for teams that have more than 20 items in their Product Backlog. 

A best practice is to conduct this technique using sticky notes placed onto a wall, whiteboard, or table. Each sticky note features a different user story or item. Using sticky notes allows the team to move user stories around in order to group them by similar theme, group, and pattern. The team begins by placing one sticky note on the board. Then, the team takes the next sticky note and discusses whether it is similar to the first item. Based on the team’s assessment, the second sticky note is placed in the first group or into its own group. 

After all of the items are grouped (there should be anywhere from 3–10 groups total), the team gives a name to each group that represents the general theme of the items. Then, the groups are prioritized by importance so that the team knows which items to tackle first. 

## Characteristics of effective estimation
Regardless of which technique your team chooses, there are several important characteristics the techniques share that lead to effective estimation:

* Avoids gathering false precision of estimates. In Scrum, assigning rough estimates results in more accuracy across the project. Therefore, if the team focuses on identifying relative estimates—rather than a team having a lengthy debate about whether a task will take seven or 10 days of work—the team saves time and avoids potentially missing deadlines.
* Avoids anchoring bias. Many of these techniques (e.g., Planning Poker) keep the initial estimate private, which allows team members to form an independent opinion on the estimate before sharing their thoughts with the team. This prevents a known phenomenon called anchoring bias, where individuals find themselves compelled to put forth estimates similar to others in the room to avoid embarrassment. 
* Promotes inclusivity. These group estimation techniques not only lead to better estimates but also help the team develop trust and cohesiveness.
* Leads to effort discovery. Estimating in these dynamic ways can help the team uncover strategies to get items completed which might otherwise not have been revealed.

## Key takeaway
There are several strategies to enlist when it comes to estimating effort and ordering your Product Backlog. Any one of these techniques are useful. Choosing a particular strategy is just a matter of what your team prefers. 

# T-shirt sizes and story points
In the previous videos, you learned about T-shirt sizes and story points—the two most common units used to help teams estimate user stories in Agile projects. In this reading, we will explore the processes of estimating user stories in these units. 

As a recap, relative estimation means to compare the effort estimated for completing a backlog item to the effort estimated for another backlog item. Doing this instead of trying to determine exactly how long a task will take allows your comparisons and estimates to be more accurate relative to one another.

## T-shirt sizes
At first, T-shirt sizes may seem like a somewhat unusual way to measure an item or user story. But when you think about assigning estimations to items based on sizes (e.g., XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL), it is actually very helpful and easy. Some of the benefits to using this technique are that it is quick, well understood by Agile experts, and a good introduction for teams who are just learning relative estimation. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79896959/227766445-0b750d9a-5f63-44ca-9748-4db87d1e3f8a.png)

So what does the process of assigning T-shirt sizes entail? There are several specific techniques a team can try, but each generally follows these steps. The team: 

* Agrees on the chosen scale and metrics to be used.
* Identifies at least one anchor backlog item. That item will be assigned a T-shirt size. Some teams will choose two anchor items—one at the top of the range and one at the bottom of the range.
* Sorts through the remaining backlog items and agrees on T-shirt sizes for each of them. 

## Story points
Using story points as the estimate unit is a little more advanced than T-shirt sizes, but it is essentially the same concept. This method is good for experienced teams. When using story points, teams usually use the Fibonacci sequence. As a reminder, this sequence comes from adding the two previous numbers in the sequence together. For example, 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 3 = 5. The important thing to notice about this sequence is that, as the list continues on, the numbers spread further apart from each other. Because of this, story points provide more accuracy and specificity than T-shirt sizes. 

So what does the process of assigning story points entail? There are several specific techniques a team can try, but the basic steps are the same as with T-shirt sizes. The team: 

* Agrees on the permitted points values. Some teams cap the size at a certain number, like 21. Some teams decide to jump from 21 to 100 as the next larger value. This is a team decision.
* Identifies at least one anchor backlog item and agrees to assign it a points value. Some teams will choose two anchor items, one at the top of the range and one at the bottom of the range.
* Sorts through the remaining backlog items as a team, agrees on an estimate for each item, and captures it in the backlog management system. 

## Best practices
Some best practices, regardless of the technique you use, include:
* Asking the Product Owner questions about the user story or item to ensure that there is enough information to estimate it.
* Discussing divergent estimates from various team members so that everyone has a chance to understand how to implement the item.
* Agreeing on the final T-shirt sizes or points value and capturing it in the system.
* If certain items fall into the larger T-shirt size or story points value range, discussing whether it makes sense to break them down into smaller pieces before moving on.

## Key takeaway
Either of these effort estimation units are effective at estimating your items and user stories. As a team, it is important to spend the appropriate amount of time deciding which is best for you. If you are a less experienced team, try starting out with T-shirt sizes, but more advanced teams should feel free to use either method. 

# The Sprint: The Scrum Guide overview
As a recap, please read this overview of the Sprint taken directly from [the 2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#the-sprint):

## The Sprint
Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.

They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
* Quality does not decrease;
* The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
* Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short project.

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.

# Releasable Increment versus Minimum Viable Product
You have learned that the Product Increment is what is produced after a given Sprint and is considered releasable. The Scrum Guide states that “An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.”

## Potentially releasable product increment
Potentially releasable (or shippable) Product Increment is a handy way for teams to think about the desired result of a Sprint. The goal for every Sprint is to result in a completed, tested, ready-to-ship addition to the product or solution. This doesn’t mean the product will actually ship to customers—that is why they use the word “potentially.” Consider, for example, building an application for finding and adopting pets. Three features on the product backlog could be: 

* Presenting information about available pets
* Rating potential matches based on adopters
* Allowing user to contact the adoption center

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79896959/227769465-4416c10e-2c09-4624-b108-dacb9bab7882.png)

It doesn’t make sense to ship any one of those features in isolation, but finishing a potentially releasable Product Increment is helpful because it enables the team to see one feature in its entirety rather than to work on bits and pieces of all three features with none of them actually completed. With a potentially releasable Product Increment, you will create a complete, working, tested implementation of one feature in a single sprint.

Having a potentially releasable Increment also allows the team to get early feedback on the product, ensure that the work is high quality, and have the opportunity to respond to change. You should always focus on a potentially releasable product increment as your sprint goal.

## Definition of Done
A related term is the Definition of Done. The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the potentially releasable Product Increment and what it means when it meets the quality measures required for the product. It is the team’s agreed-upon requirements for any backlog item that is considered “done.” In software projects, teams often decide that “done” means the software has been completed, reviewed, and has passed testing. In a non-software project, a Definition of Done may be a document including a legal review with approval or a formalized closeout report. The important part of figuring out your team’s Definition of Done is to have an explicit, shared understanding of what being “done” entails.

But how do you know when a solution is shippable or releasable? In a Scrum Team, it is ultimately the decision of the Product Owner to ensure there is value before releasing an item. To determine this, they may consider a few things: 

* Is the increment complete? 
* Will it bring value and does it meet quality measures? Has it been well-tested? 
* Is it usable by the end user? Can we use their direct or indirect feedback to improve future versions of the product?

## Comparing Releasable Product Increment to Minimum Viable Product
As you learned in the previous video, a minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers. Eric Ries, an entrepreneur and author, coined the term in this guide and defined an MVP as “that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.” In other words, gathering insights from an MVP enables quicker feedback from users than developing a full-featured product that may not be 100% tested or secure. Some examples of an MVP could be a landing page for your website or a “buy now” button that doesn't do anything other than register that someone has clicked it. 

A minimum viable product is a package of features that may take several sprints to develop, but every sprint’s goal is to produce a product increment. To differentiate between a potentially releasable increment and a MVP, let’s take our example of the online pet adoption app and the three features we discussed previously. We noted that each of these features on their own wasn’t a useful release of the solution. However, the Product Owner may decide that the MVP for this user experience is to implement these three requirements for cats only. By reducing the scope of the MVP, the Product Owner is able to release the solution into the marketplace and collect feedback from the users who wish to adopt cats. This feedback will be valuable not only for the cat adoption process but for any type of pet adoption in future iterations of the product. 

## Key takeaway
So can a releasable increment be an MVP? Yes!  Does it always have to be an MVP? Not necessarily. A Scrum Master or Product Owner is always making sure that the team is building potentially releasable increments of the solution or product. Then, the Product Owner uses those product increments and business insights to determine what will make up a valuable and viable release of the product to their customers. This is based on both user value delivered and the ability to gather feedback that will continuously improve the product.
