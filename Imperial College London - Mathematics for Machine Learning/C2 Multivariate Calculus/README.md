## About this course

Welcome to Mathematics for Machine Learning: Multivariate Calculus! You’re joining thousands of learners currently enrolled in the course. We are excited to have you in the class and look forward to your contributions to the learning community.

To begin, we recommend taking a few minutes to explore the course site. Review the material we’ll cover each week, and preview the assignments you’ll need to complete to pass the course.

The course is composed of 6 weeks:

In weeks 1 - 4 you build and get familiar with a mathematics toolkit

In weeks 5 - 6 you learn how to apply this toolkit to optimization problems

Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to play with interactive visualisations of some of the concepts, and will get a chance to implement them yourself in Python. If you've not had much experience with code before don’t worry, we will give you lots of guidance as you go.
