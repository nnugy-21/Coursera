## About This Module
In Module 4, we continue our discussion of matrices; first we think about how to code up matrix multiplication and matrix operations using the Einstein Summation Convention, which is a widely used notation in more advanced linear algebra courses. Then, we look at how matrices can transform a description of a vector from one basis (set of axes) to another. This will allow us to, for example, figure out how to apply a reflection to an image and manipulate images. We'll also look at how to construct a convenient basis vector set in order to do such transformations. Then, we'll write some code to do these transformations and apply this work computationally.

## Learning Objectives
* Identify matrices as operators
* Relate the transformation matrix to a set of new basis vectors
* Formulate code for mappings based on these transformation matrices
* Write code to find an orthonormal basis set computationally
