## About This Module
Eigenvectors are particular vectors that are unrotated by a transformation matrix, and eigenvalues are the amount by which the eigenvectors are stretched. These special 'eigen-things' are very useful in linear algebra and will let us examine Google's famous PageRank algorithm for presenting web search results. Then we'll apply this in code, which will wrap up the course.

## Learning Objectives
* Identify geometrically what an eigenvector/value is
* Apply mathematical formulation in simple cases
* Build an intuition of larger dimention eigensystems
* Write code to solve a large dimentional eigen problem
