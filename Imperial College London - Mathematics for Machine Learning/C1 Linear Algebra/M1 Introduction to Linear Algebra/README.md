In this first module we look at how linear algebra is relevant to machine learning and data science. Then we'll wind up the module with an initial introduction to vectors. Throughout, we're focussing on developing your mathematical intuition, not of crunching through algebra or doing long pen-and-paper examples. For many of these operations, there are callable functions in Python that can do the adding up - the point is to appreciate what they do and how they work so that, when things go wrong or there are special cases, you can understand why and what to do.

## Learning Objectives
* Recall how machine learning and vectors and matrices are related
* Interpret how changes in the model parameters affect the quality of the fit to the training data
* Recognize that variations in the model parameters are vectors on the response surface - that vectors are a generic concept not limited to a physical real space
* Use substitution / elimination to solve a fairly easy linear algebra problem
* Understand how to add vectors and multiply by a scalar number
