## About This Module
In this module, we look at operations we can do with vectors - finding the modulus (size), angle between vectors (dot or inner product) and projections of one vector onto another. We can then examine how the entries describing a vector will depend on what vectors we use to define the axes - the basis. That will then let us determine whether a proposed set of basis vectors are what's called 'linearly independent.' This will complete our examination of vectors, allowing us to move on to matrices in module 3 and then start to solve linear algebra problems.

## Learning Objectives
* Calculate basic operations (dot product, modulus, negation) on vectors
* Calculate a change of basis
* Recall linear independence
* Identify a linearly independent basis and relate this to the dimensionality of the space
