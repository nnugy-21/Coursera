## About This Module
Now that we've looked at vectors, we can turn to matrices. First we look at how to use matrices as tools to solve linear algebra problems, and as objects that transform vectors. Then we look at how to solve systems of linear equations using matrices, which will then take us on to look at inverse matrices and determinants, and to think about what the determinant really is, intuitively speaking. Finally, we'll look at cases of special matrices that mean that the determinant is zero or where the matrix isn't invertible - cases where algorithms that need to invert a matrix will fail.

## Learning Objectives
* Understand what a matrix is and how it corresponds to a transformation.
* Explain and calculate inverse and determinant of matrices
* Identify and explain how to find inverses computationally and what goes wrong.
