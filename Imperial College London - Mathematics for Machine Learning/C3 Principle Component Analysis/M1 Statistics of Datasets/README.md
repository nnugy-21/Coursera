## About this course

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most important dimensionality reduction algorithms in machine learning. In this course, we lay the mathematical foundations to derive and understand PCA from a geometric point of view. In this module, we learn how to summarize datasets (e.g., images) using basic statistics, such as the mean and the variance. We also look at properties of the mean and the variance when we shift or scale the original data set. We will provide mathematical intuition as well as the skills to derive the results. We will also implement our results in code (jupyter notebooks), which will allow us to practice our mathematical understand to compute averages of image data sets. Therefore, some python/numpy background will be necessary to get through this course. Note: If you have taken the other two courses of this specialization, this one will be harder (mostly because of the programming assignments). However, if you make it through the first week of this course, you will make it through the full course with high probability.

## Learning Objectives

* Compute basic statistics of data sets
* Interpret the effects of linear transformations on means and (co)variances
* Compute means/variances of linearly transformed data sets
* Write code that represents images as vectors
* Write code that computes basic statistics of datasets
