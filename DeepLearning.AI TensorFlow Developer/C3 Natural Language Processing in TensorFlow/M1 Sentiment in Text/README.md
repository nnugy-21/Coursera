## About this Course
The first step in understanding sentiment in text, and in particular when training a neural network to do so is the tokenization of that text. This is the process of converting the text into numeric values, with a number representing a word or a character. This week you'll learn about the Tokenizer and pad_sequences APIs in TensorFlow and how they can be used to prepare and encode text and sentences to get them ready for training neural networks!
