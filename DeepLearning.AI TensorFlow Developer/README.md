## About this Professional Certificate
TensorFlow is one of the most in-demand and popular open-source deep learning frameworks available today. The DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program teaches you applied machine learning skills with TensorFlow so you can build and train powerful models. 

In this hands-on, four-course Professional Certificate program, you’ll learn the necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow. After finishing this program, you’ll be able to apply your new TensorFlow skills to a wide range of problems and projects. This program can help you prepare for the Google TensorFlow Certificate exam and bring you one step closer to achieving the Google TensorFlow Certificate.

Ready to deploy your models to the world? Learn how to go live with your models with the TensorFlow: Data and Deployment Specialization.

Looking to customize and build powerful real-world models for complex scenarios? Check out the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization.

## Applied Learning Projects
In the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program, you'll get hands-on experience through 16 Python programming assignments. By the end of this program, you will be ready to: 

* Build and train neural networks using TensorFlow

* Improve your network’s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images

* Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems

* Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and train a model to create original poetry!

## What You Will Learn
* Best practices for TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework to train a neural network for a computer vision applications.

* Handle real-world image data and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.

* Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.

* Apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs as you train them using text repositories.
